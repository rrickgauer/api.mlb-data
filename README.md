## Overview

Currently, there are 2 modules offered in the API:

1. **people**
2. **search**


The **people** module, is where you obtain all the available information related to a person. Specifically, you can find a player's batting stats, pitching stats, annual salary, seasonal appearances, and more.

The **search** module does exactly what it sounds like: *search* for a person. In order to retrieve any player data, you need to know the player's individual `playerID`. That is what the **search** module is for. You can search for a player by name, and it will return a list of `playerID`.
